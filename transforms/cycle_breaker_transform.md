## CycleBreakerTransform

In Dash, circular dependencies are not allowed unless they are resolved within the same callback. Hence the following code will raise an error (possibly only in JavaScript console, depending on the Dash version, and if you are running in debug mode or not),

.. python-code:: transforms.cycle_breaker_transform_error

The `CycleBreakerTransform` makes it possible to _break cycles_ in the [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) generated by Dash, thereby avoiding the error. Simply exchange the `Input` with a `CycleBreakerInput` at points where you want to remove an edge in the DAG. For the previous example, we could choose any of the `Input` objects. Choosing the first, the code is

.. dash-proxy:: transforms.cycle_breaker_transform

While the above example runs without any error, a **word of caution** is needed. The example (only) works because the cyclic invocation of the callbacks _resolve to a consistent state_. If this is not the case, the callbacks will keep updating indefinitely.
